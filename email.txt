Dear Parents/caregivers,

It has come to our attention that an individual at the school has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19. People who spend 15 minutes or longer, cumulatively, within six feet of a person infected with COVID-19 are considered exposed and at risk of contracting COVID-19.

The school's administration is working closely with the county's health Services to address this situation. We are identifying students and staff who may have been exposed to the infected individual and requiring them to follow all proper quarantine protocols and procedures.

Records indicate that you/your student have not been exposed to COVID-19 and we are not recommending testing or quarantine at this time. I have already contacted individuals who may have been exposed. If at any time the situation changes, we will let you know immediately.

With appreciation, 

The Principal

XXX School
